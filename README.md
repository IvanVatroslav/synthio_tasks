Task 1: Docker Containerization
Two containerized microservices:

Message Processor: Receives JSON messages, adds timestamps, forwards to storage
Message Store: Saves messages as JSON files with random filenames

Task 2: SQL Modeling
Three schema designs for a retail sales system:

Normalized (3NF) Schema: 12 separate tables with proper relationships
Star Schema: Denormalized dimensions with central fact table for faster reporting
Snowflake Schema: Normalized dimensions with hierarchical relationships

All schemas include queries that reconstruct the original report table.
